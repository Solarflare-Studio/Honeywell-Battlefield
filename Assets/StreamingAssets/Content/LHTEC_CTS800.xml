			<Body>The modular design of the engine enables maintenance to be completed quickly and easily. Amazingly only six tools are required to perform all CTS800 O&#x2011;level maintenance. This modular design combined with the on&#x2011;condition maintenance philosophy provides a low direct maintenance cost as well as low operating costs per flying hour and significantly reduces the through&#x2011;life maintenance cost of the engine.</Body>

			<Body>In September 2010, the X2 broke the rotorcraft world speed record. The engine makes it possible to carry more, fly higher even on hot days, and consume less fuel. Itâ€™s proven in service since 2004 with over 300,000 flight hours. The CTS800 lead the fleet engines having accumulated over 2,500 hours in service, of which over 1,700 was in a dusty desert environment.
